# HouseSales

In this project for my Data Analysis with Python course by IBM, I analyzed and predicted housing prices using attributes or features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors, and so on. As stated in the notebook, this dataset contains house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015.

Here, I showcase some elementary use cases of common data science python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, numpy, scikit-learn, and seaborn.
